Hello,

What you have here is netgraph node for mangling all outgoing (by default)
IPv4 packets flowing through specified ethernet interface. To help you start
with it a shell script go_mangle.sh is attached. You can mangle with ttl and
tos fields in every IPv4 header. This is basically all it is supposed to do.

For more info about ng_mangle go to:

If you need more sophisticated way to deal with ip packets and not arbitrary
all of them chosen on per interface basis. You may be lucky as new idea is
about to be given a birth. ;) I'll leave a note if/when it is ready on the 
page above.
